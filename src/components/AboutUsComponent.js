                        The UniMorph project is a collaborative effort to improve how NLP handles complex morphology in the worldâ€™s languages. The goal of UniMorph is to annotate morphological data in a *universal schema* that allows an inflected word from any language to be defined by its lexical meaning, typically carried by the lemma, and by a rendering of its inflectional form in terms of a bundle of morphological features from our schema.

                        The Unimorph presents the data collected both from the English part of Wiktionary and linguists.
                        Unlike Wiktionary, UniMorph provides a friendly interface that allows users (linguists, informants, annotators) to edit entries and add new data.
                        Its universal schema serves as a great source of knowledge for cross-linguistic studies and analyses as well as can be found useful in the development of multilingual systems (machine translation, automatic morphological inflection, and other scenarios).
